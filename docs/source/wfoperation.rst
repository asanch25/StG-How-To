What to do in case of a spark
-----------------------------
If you notice a spark in the WF the steps are as follows:

#. Immediately put in the HIPPO entrance cup using the Stg Magnet control panel. 
#. Press the **SET Pos DC** and **SET Neg DC** buttons to stop the WF from immediately trying to go back up to the set voltage
#. Set the negative and positive power supplies to zero and press **SET BOTH POWER SUPPLIES** button. 
#. Press the **SET Pos DC** and **SET Neg DC** buttons again. 
#. Wait a minute or two and then bring WF up to required voltage while keeping an eye on the stability.
