The St. George Dipole magnets are responsible for the charge state selection of the recoils after being created in the HIPPO gas target. In analogy with traditional optics, a dipole magnet seperates particles by p/q much like a prism seperates light by wavelength.



Quadrupole Magnets
------------
In addition to the 6 dipole magnets, St. George also has 11 quadrupole magnets for focusing and defocusing the beam. The important thing to remember about quadrupole magnets is that if the quadrupole focuses in one direction, lets say in the x direction, it defocuses in the other direction.  It is for this reason that in every application I can think of, quadrupole magnets come in pairs or even triplets. 


Wien Filter
------------
The Wien filter is the location where the majority of the rejection of the primary beam takes place. We set the fields of a perpendicular electric and magnetic field to tune the Wien filter to only allow particles of a specific velocity through. Luckily this effect is easily explainable with only a semester (maybe) of electromagnetism.
