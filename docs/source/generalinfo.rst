The St. George Dipole magnets are responsible for the charge state selection of the recoils after being created in the HIPPO gas target. In analogy with traditional optics, a dipole magnet seperates particles by p/q much like a prism seperates light by wavelength.



Quadrupole Magnets
------------
In addition to the 6 dipole magnets, St. George also has 11 quadrupole magnets for focusing and defocusing the beam. The important thing to remember about quadrupole magnets is that if the quadrupole focuses in one direction, lets say in the x direction, it defocuses in the other direction.  It is for this reason that in every application I can think of, quadrupole magnets come in pairs or even triplets.
