HIPPO Operation
===============

Vacuum operation
----------------
Starting with HIPPO mechanically closed but at atmospheric pressure, the pumping operation is as follows:

#. Close the nitrogen vent valve (Photo 1).
#. Ensure the XDS35 pump exhaust valve to atmosphere is open (Photo 2).
#. Ensure the XDS35 pump is ON (Photo 3).
#. Depending on the status of other sections of St. George and the 5U beam line:
   * Close the beam line gate valve at the wall before the quad triplet (Photo 4).
   * Close the beam line gate valve between Q2 and B1 (Photo 5).
   * This isolates HIPPO from the rest of the beamline (Photo 6).

#. Gently open the vacuum operation turbo backing valve (Photo 2) on top of the XDS35 pump.
   * Gradually open the valve until fully open as the pump sound improves.

#. Check that the vacuum readings on CG2 gauges 1-4 (see Photo 7 and the hornet gauge guide) are decreasing.
   * If not, there may be a problem such as leaks or components not being closed properly.

#. Turn on the 4 hornet IGs and verify they indicate activity after 5-10 seconds (Photo 7).

#. When CG2 readings on the gauges reach approximately 1E-1 mbar or better, turn on the 5 turbo pumps using LabVIEW on the console (Photo 16).
   * The LabVIEW code for this operation is located on the St. George control terminal and can be found in XXX.

#. The vacuum as indicated by the four ion gauges on LabVIEW should reach better than ~5x10-5 mbar within 2-3 minutes.

#. Done.
